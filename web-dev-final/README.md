Introduction:<br>
I am working on one of the final projects for my web development fundamentals class and was inspired by a friend to start using GitHub. This project is supposed to be a demonstration of basic HTML and CSS. I will be the only contributor.

Updates:<br>
17 June 2017:<br>in its current form the project is structured with the master branch as an initial snapshot that I could fall back on in case things went awry (i already deleted all of my school files trying to set up github, thankfully i had last nights backup). the layout-1 branch is a mobile first design for at least the main page and is still in-progress. after i complete the work on the footer nav elements i plan to create another branch called layout-1-wide targeted at desktop browsers.
<br><br>
18 June 2017:<br>something was wrong with my implementation of the mobile first design strategy. when i branched and started working on the wide layout everything fell apart. i took the time to rebuild the navmenu and footers and touched up other things. the site is in working condition and awaits testing.
<br><br>
tested, fixed, and merged first layout then branched for second layout. still working things out while building the second layout. i think the second layout is in good enough shape to branch into the third layout to knock out more requirements while keeping my eye out for problems in the second layout. i do want to recheck requirements and maybe get rid of two of the four sections.
<br><br>
19 June 2017:<br>branched, creating a template file for future use, testing ideas for last layout, have a working page to fill with content, still need to cut sections from first two layouts.
<br><br>
20 June 2017:<br>uploaded more images, filled in the moon page a bit, i had a blast coding this entire project but i draw blanks on design ideas, organized files, updated nav and footer code across all pages, created templates for layout-2 and layout-3, created filler pages so there are no broken links, i plan to meet with a teacher tomorrow to get an idea if i'm on the right course or not.
<br><br>
21 June 2017:<br>content filled pages, touch ups, added extra links to events; coded everything to work even if there was no content with the goal of having a super productive meeting with my instructor, during the meeting he was reviewing the project and decided to give me the full score for the assignment and asked me to focus my efforts on the next assignment which is a portfolio, i guess this means i will be putting this project on hold indefinitely, will i return? only the stars will know...
